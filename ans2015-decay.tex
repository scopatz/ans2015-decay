\section{Introduction}

The Bateman equations governing radioactive decay are an important 
subexpression of generalized transmutation equations. In many cases, it is 
desirable to compute decay on its own, outside of the presence of a neutron 
or photon field.  In this case radioactive decay is a function solely on 
intrinsic physical parameters, namely half-lives. This document recasts the 
Bateman equations into a form that is better suited for computation than the 
traditional expression.

This use case is particularly relevant to the study of the nuclear fuel 
cycle (NFC). While reactors are a critical component of most NFCs, there 
are many places in the cycle where fresh and used fuel is sitting outside 
of a core. In these cases, decay alone is needed. Full transumation 
calculations require excessive computational effort when simply trying to 
model a storage facility. Thus, an efficient decay calculator has the 
potential to speed up simulation of the entire NFC.

Here, the traditional Bateman decay equations have been reformualted to 
a expression that is more suited for binary compuation. Coupled with a 
novel code generation technique, this binary formulation provides 
dramatic speed increases in a modern computing environment. 

Notably, all of the software implemented for the decay calculation is 
available as part of the free \& open source PyNE library 
\cite{pyne2014,Bates2014}. Furthermore, this decay functionality has
been fully integrated into the \cyclus fuel cycle simulator
\cite{cyclus2015,cyclus_v1.2}.

This paper will start by reviewing the classic version of the Bateman 
equations in \S II before providing the desired departure from 
this form in \S III. Following this, implementation specific 
approximations are discussed in \S IV.

\section{Canonical Bateman Equations for Decay}
\label{canon}
The canonical expression of the Bateman equations for a decay chain 
proceeding from a nuclide $A$ to a nuclide $Z$ at time 
$t$ following a specific path is as follows \cite{Cetnar2006640}:

\begin{equation}
\label{bm-eq}
N_C(t) = \frac{N_1(0)}{\lambda_C} \cdot \gamma \cdot \sum_{i=1}^C \lambda_i c_{i} e^{-\lambda_i t}
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[hbt]
\label{decay-symbol-meaning}
\caption{Symbol Meaning in Deacy Equations}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Meaning} \\
\hline
$C$         & length of the decay chain\\
$i$         & index for ith species, on range [1, C]\\
$j$         & index for jth species, on range [1, C]\\
$t$         & time [seconds]\\
$N_i(t)$    & number density of the ith species at time t\\
$t_{1/2,i}$ & half-life of the ith species\\
$\lambda_i$ & decay constant of ith species, $ln(2)/t_{1/2,i}$\\
$\gamma$    & total branch ratio for this chain\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The symbols in \ref{bm-eq} have the meaning described in Table I.
Additionally, $c_{i}$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\label{c_i}
c_i = \prod_{j=1,i\ne j}^C \frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda_j - \lambda_i}
\end{equation}

Furthermore, the total chain branch ratio is defined as the product of the 
branch ratio between any two species in the chain \cite{harr2007precise}:

\begin{equation}
\label{gamma}
\gamma = \prod_{i=i}^{C-1} \gamma_{i \to i+1}
\end{equation}

Minor modifications are needed for terminal species: the first nuclide of a 
decay chain and the ending stable species. By setting $C=1$, the Bateman
equations can be reduced to simply:

\begin{equation}
\label{N_C}
N_C(t) = N_1(0) e^{-\lambda_1 t}
\end{equation}

For stable species, the appropriate equation is derived by taking the limit
of when the decay constant of the stable nuclide ($\lambda_C$) goes to 
zero.  Also notice that every $c_i$ contains exactly one $\lambda_C$
in the numerator which cancels with the $\lambda_C$ in the denominator 
in front of the summation:

\begin{equation}
\label{lim_lam}
\lim_{\lambda_C \to 0} N_C(t) = N_1(0)  \gamma \left[e^{-0t} + \sum_{i=1}^{C-1} \lambda_i \left(\frac{1}{0 - \lambda_i} \prod_{j=1,i\ne j}^{C-1} \frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda_j - \lambda_i} \right) e^{-\lambda_i t} \right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{lim_lam_N_C}
N_C(t) = N_1(0)  \gamma \left[1.0 - \sum_{i=1}^{C-1} \left(\prod_{j=1,i\ne j}^{C-1} \frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda_j - \lambda_i} \right) e^{-\lambda_i t} \right]
\end{equation}


\section{Binary Reformulation of Bateman Equations}
\label{bin}
There are two main strategies can be used to construct a version of these 
equations that is better suited to computation, if not clarity. 

First, lets aim for minimizing the number of 
operations that must be performed to achieve the same result. This can be done 
by grouping constants together and pre-calculating them. This saves the 
computer from having to perform the same operations at run time.  It is 
possible to express the Bateman equations as a simple sum of exponentials

\begin{equation}
\label{N_C_bin}
N_C(t) = N_1(0) \sum_{i=1}^C k_{i} e^{-\lambda_i t}
\end{equation}

where the coefficients $k_i$ are defined as:

\begin{equation}
\label{k_i}
k_i = \frac{\gamma}{\lambda_C} \lambda_i c_i
\end{equation}

If $k_i$ are computed at run time then the this expression results in much 
more computational effort that than the original Bateman equations since $\gamma/\lambda_C$ 
are brought into the summation. However, when $k_i$ are pre-caluclated, 
many floating point operations are saved by avoiding explicitly computing $c_i$.

The second strategy is to note that computers are much better at dealing with powers of
2 then then any other base, even $e$. Thus the $exp2(x)$ function, or $2^x$,
is faster than the natural exponential function $$exp(x)$$, $e^x$.  As proof of this
the following are some simple timing results:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Exponential Timing Comparison}, 
                   label=expcmp]
In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: r = np.random.random(1000) / np.random.random(1000)

In [3]: \%timeit np.exp(r)
10000 loops, best of 3: 26.6 us per loop

In [4]: \%timeit np.exp2(r)
10000 loops, best of 3: 20.1 us per loop
\end{lstlisting}

This is a savings of about 25\%.  Since the core of the Bateman equations are exponentials, 
it is worthwhile to squeeze this algorithm as much as possible.  Luckily, the decay constant
provides an intrinsic mechanism to convert to base-2:

\begin{equation}
\label{b2-0}
N_C(t) = N_1(0) \sum_{i=1}^C k_{i} e^{-\lambda_i t}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{b2-1}
N_C(t) = N_1(0) \sum_{i=1}^C k_{i} e^{\frac{-\ln(2)\cdot t}{t_{1/2,i}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{b2-2}
N_C(t) = N_1(0) \sum_{i=1}^C k_{i} 2^{\frac{-t}{t_{1/2,i}}}
\end{equation}

This expression can be further collapsed by defining $a$ to be the precomputed 
exponent values:

\begin{equation}
\label{a_i}
a_i = \frac{-1}{t_{1/2,i}}
\end{equation}

Thus, the final form of the binary representation of the Bateman equations are
as follows:

\textbf{General Formulation:}

\begin{equation}
\label{nc_wakka}
N_C(t) = N_1(0) \sum_{i=1}^C k_{i} 2^{a_i t}
\end{equation}

\textbf{First Nuclide in Chain:}

\begin{equation}
\label{nc_jawakka}
N_C(t) = N_1(0) \cdot 2^{a_1 t}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Stable Nuclide:}

\begin{equation}
\label{nc_brown_shoes}
N_C(t) = N_1(0) \left[1.0 + \sum_{i=1}^{C-1} \lim_{\lambda_C\to 0}(k_{i}) \cdot 2^{a_i t} \right]
\end{equation}

With completely precomputed $k$, $a$, and the $exp2()$ function, this 
formulation minimizes the number of floating point operations while completely 
preserving physics. No assumptions were made aside from the Bateman equations 
themselves in this proof.

Note that it is not possible to reduce the number of operations further.  This 
is because  $k$ and $a$ cannot be combined without adding further 
operations.

\section{Implementation Specific Approximations}
\label{approx}
The above formulation holds generally for any decay chain.  However, certain 
approximations are used in practice to reduce the number of chains and terms 
that are calculated.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Decay chains coming from spontaneous fission are not tallied as they 
    lead to an explosion of the total number of chains while contributing to 
    extraordinarily rare branches.
\item Decay alphas are not treated as He-4 production.
\item For chains longer than length 2, any 
    term whose half-life is less than $10^{-8}$ of the sum of all 
    half-lives in the chain is dropped. This filtering prevents excessive
    calculation from species which do not significantly contribute to 
    end atom fraction. The threshold $10^{-8}$ was chosen as 
    because it is a reasonable naive estimate of floating point error after 
    many operations. If the filtering causes there to be less than 
    two terms in the summation, then the filtering is turned off and all
    terms are computed.
\item To prevent other sources of floating point error, a nuclide is determined 
    to be stable when $\lambda_i < 10^{-16}$, rather than when 
    $\lambda_i = 0.0$.
\item If a chain has any $$NaN$$ decay constants, the chain in rejected.
\item If a chain has any infinite $k$, the chain in rejected.
\end{enumerate}

In principle, each of these statements is reasonable. However, they
may preclude desired behavior by users. In such a situation, these 
assumptions should be revisited.
